              We'll use your car's location to calculate your onboard bonus. Each ZIP code will belong to one of five zones.
              Zones are based on guest demand for carsâ€”more guest demand means a higher zone, and bigger bonuses for cars.
              Zone 1 gets the highest bonus, while Zones 4 and 5 aren't eligible for the onboard bonus.
